/* The server package should contain all code to run the server. The server uses TCP sockets and thread per client.
 The server should connect to a MySql database to register clients, allow them to login and choose courses
 The server should listen for connections and once a connection is accepted it should spawn a new CAOClientHandler
 thread to deal with that connection. The server then returns to listening
